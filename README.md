# Project Description

Health insurance plays a vital role in protecting individuals, families, and organizations from the financial burdens associated with unexpected medical expenses. To improve decision-making processes and enhance the accuracy of insurance premium calculations, this project explores the application of machine learning algorithms.

# The project includes the following components:

**Features**
 
1. Exploring the dataset
2. Converting Categorical values to Numerical
3. Plotting Heatmap to see dependency of Dependent valeu on Independent features
4. Data Visualization (Plots of feature vs feature)
5. Plotting Skew and Kurtosis
6. Data Preparation
7. Prediction using Linear Regression
8. Prediction using SVR
9. Prediction using Ridge Regressor
10. Prediction using Random Forest Regressor
11. Performing Hyper tuning for above mentioned models
12. Plotting Graph for all Models to compare performance
13. Preparing model for deployment
14. Deployed model using Flask

**Data**: The repository provides access to the dataset used in the project. The dataset contains information about various parameters related to patients' health profiles, such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and geographical region.

**Code**: The repository includes the code implementation for training and evaluating the machine learning models. Multiple regression models, including Multiple Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Simple Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Polynomial Regression, are implemented to predict health insurance costs based on the provided dataset.Each model is implemented using appropriate libraries and techniques to ensure accurate predictions based on the provided dataset.

**Presentation (PPT)**: The presentation slides provide an overview of the project, its objectives, methodology, and results. It also explains the significance of incorporating machine learning models in the health insurance sector and how they can improve premium determination.

**Project Report (PDF)**: The comprehensive project report documents the entire project lifecycle, including data preprocessing, model development, evaluation metrics, and results analysis. It provides detailed insights into the implementation process, performance comparisons of the regression models, and recommendations for future improvements.

**Usage**
