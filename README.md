# Project Description

Health insurance plays a vital role in protecting individuals, families, and organizations from the financial burdens associated with unexpected medical expenses. To improve decision-making processes and enhance the accuracy of insurance premium calculations, this project explores the application of machine learning algorithms.

# The project includes the following components:

**Data**: The repository provides access to the dataset used in the project. The dataset contains information about various parameters related to patients' health profiles, such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and geographical region.

**Code**: The repository includes the code implementation for training and evaluating the machine learning models. Multiple regression models, including Multiple Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Simple Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Polynomial Regression, are implemented to predict health insurance costs based on the provided dataset.Each model is implemented using appropriate libraries and techniques to ensure accurate predictions based on the provided dataset.

**Presentation (PPT)**: The presentation slides provide an overview of the project, its objectives, methodology, and results. It also explains the significance of incorporating machine learning models in the health insurance sector and how they can improve premium determination.

**Project Report (PDF)**: The comprehensive project report documents the entire project lifecycle, including data preprocessing, model development, evaluation metrics, and results analysis. It provides detailed insights into the implementation process, performance comparisons of the regression models, and recommendations for future improvements.

**Usage**

**Data:** The dataset can be downloaded from the provided link in the repository. It is stored in a CSV format and can be used for further analysis or additional model development.

**Code**: The code files (.ipynb) can be executed in a Jupyter Notebook environment or any other Python environment with the required dependencies installed. The code includes data preprocessing steps, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

**Presentation (PPT)**: The presentation slides provide an overview of the project and can be used to showcase the project's objectives, methodology, and key findings.

**Project Report (PDF)**: The project report contains a detailed description of the project, including the dataset, methodology, model implementation, and evaluation. It serves as a comprehensive documentation resource for the project.
